*Wav Stuff* 
(for me for later)

(8-bit unsigned range is 0 - 255)
8-bit is unsigned, so 128 is silence

(16-bit signed is 32,767 to -32,768, unsigned is just 0 to 32,767)
16-bit is signed, so maybe use a data type larger than 16-bit, and add 32,768, then do the math the same way that you did the math for 8-bit
